Natural Language to SQL Conversion Project
Comprehensive Project Report and Approach Analysis

ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary
This project implements a Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) conversion system that transforms human-readable questions into executable SQL queries. Instead of using the suggested traditional models, I adopted a modern LLM-based approach using Groq API with Llama3-70B, which provides superior performance and more robust query generation capabilities.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives & Requirements Analysis
Original Task Requirements:

Convert natural language queries into SQL using pre-trained models
Implement working demo script
Evaluate performance using exact match and execution accuracy
Provide comprehensive evaluation results

My Enhanced Approach:

âœ… Exceeded requirements by implementing a full-stack web application
âœ… Real-time query execution with live database integration
âœ… Interactive web interface for better user experience
âœ… Comprehensive error handling and query validation
âœ… Production-ready deployment on Hugging Face Spaces

1. Model Selection Decision
Why I Changed from Suggested Models:
Suggested ModelsLimitations FoundMy Solutiontscholak/optimum-nl2sqlâ€¢ Limited schema flexibility<br>â€¢ Fixed training data constraints<br>â€¢ Lower accuracy on complex queriesGroq Llama3-70Bb-mc2/sqlcoderâ€¢ Accessibility issues<br>â€¢ Resource-intensive local deploymentCloud-based APISalesforce/grappa_largeâ€¢ Outdated model architecture<br>â€¢ Limited natural language understandingState-of-the-art LLM
Advantages of Groq + Llama3-70B:

ðŸš€ Superior Natural Language Understanding: Better context interpretation
âš¡ Faster Inference: Groq's optimized inference engine
ðŸŽ¯ Higher Accuracy: Advanced reasoning capabilities
ðŸ”§ Schema Flexibility: Adapts to any database schema
ðŸ“ˆ Scalability: Cloud-based solution

2. Architecture Design
